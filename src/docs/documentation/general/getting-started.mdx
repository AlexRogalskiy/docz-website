# Getting Started

> ⚠️ Since v1 you need `react` and `react-dom` with `>= 16.8.0` installed.

## Migration Guide

This documentation it's about v1. If you need to migrate your Docz project, please read our [Migration Guide](/docs/migration-guide)

## Installation

Getting started with **Docz** is something really easy and quick.
First of all, you will need to install **Docz** and some theme on your project using your favorite package manager (we'll assume yarn for this example):

```bash
$ yarn add docz@next docz-theme-default@next --dev
```

> ### Tips and tricks
>
> After you installed Docz in your project, you may find it convenient to add two scripts in your `package.json` to run Docz for you. This is an **optional step**:

```json
{
  "name": "mycoolproject",
  "scripts": {
    "docz:dev": "docz dev",
    "docz:build": "docz build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "docz": "latest"
  }
}
```

Now you can spin up your dev server just by running:

```
$ yarn docz:dev
```

## Using

With your dev server up, you can start writing your documentation.

Docz uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) as a standard format because of the flexibility of writing JSX inside markdown files.

Note that you **don't need to follow any strict file architecture**. You can just create your `.mdx` files **anywhere in your project**.

So, let's create our first `.mdx` and give it a name:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
---

# Hello world

Hello, I'm a mdx file!
```

With your first `.mdx` created, you can open your browser and visit `localhost:3000` and you should see something like this:
