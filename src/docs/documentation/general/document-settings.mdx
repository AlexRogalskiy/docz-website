# Document settings

Document settings can be something simple, but powerful. They should be defined in the top of the `.mdx`
using yaml and can be used to change whatever you want by passing this config to your theme.

By default the document has just three properties that can't be overrided:

```markdown
---
name: My Document
route: /custom-route
menu: Documents
---
```

These properties are self-explanatory, but here is their definition:

- `name` Define the name of your component.
- `route *(optional)*` Define the route of your component.

>If you don't pass any here, we'll create a slug getting the filepath of your file as route.

- `menu  *(optional)*` Group documents into a single menu by changing this prop.

## Custom properties

With just this properties perhaps you couldn't do many customizations.
But, all documents can have arbitrary properties and you can use them to built your theme.

Example: you can define a property called `fullpage` to define whether your document is a page with `100%` width or not:

```
---
name: My Document
fullpage: true
---
```

Now when you're creating your theme you can use this property to define inside your page component if shows a container of not.

This is very powerful and gives you flexibility when developing your own themes.
